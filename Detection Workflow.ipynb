    "# Monitoring artisanal fishing activity in Gunjur Bay (The Gambia)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a transparent, reproducible workflow to **detect and count artisanal fishing boats** in Gunjur Bay (The Gambia) using ~3 m PlanetScope surface reflectance imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why:\n",
    "- Coastal communities in southern Gambia depend on small-scale fishing.\n",
    "- Fishmeal / fish oil (FMFO) factories operating nearby have been accused of over-extracting fish for export.\n",
    "- We want independent, open monitoring of fishing effort: *How many boats are in the water? When?*\n",
    "\n",
    "What this notebook does:\n",
    "1. Loads a PlanetScope scene (multispectral GeoTIFF).\n",
    "2. Builds a true-color RGB preview.\n",
    "3. Computes NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) to separate water from everything else.\n",
    "4. Creates a binary \"water mask\" using an NDWI threshold that **you choose**.\n",
    "5. Cleans that mask and clips it to the bay polygon (region of interest).\n",
    "6. Treats \"holes in water\" as candidate boats, labels them, filters by size, and counts them.\n",
    "7. Draws bounding boxes so a human can visually confirm detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this notebook is **not**:\n",
    "- It's not estimating biomass, catch volume, or fishing pressure in tons. A higher boat count is a proxy for fishing effort — it's not a direct measure of fish extraction.\n",
    "- It's not a deep learning model. It's deliberately simple and auditable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions / caveats:\n",
    "- Works best on calm water, low turbidity, low sunglint.\n",
    "- Boats that raft together may merge into one detection - therefore estimates are conservative.\n",
    "- Very foamy surf / breaking waves can look like small \"non-water\" blobs and inflate counts.\n",
    "- You **must** pick the NDWI threshold manually per scene (details below). Different dates and lighting need different thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1. Compute NDWI.\n",
    "2. Pick a threshold that makes open water = white and boats = dark.\n",
    "3. Clean the water mask.\n",
    "4. Clip to the bay polygon.\n",
    "5. Connected components ⇒ boat blobs ⇒ count.\n"

    "**Concept**\n",
    "- We call a pixel \"water\" if `NDWI > threshold`.\n",
    "- Everything else becomes \"not water\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "- Once we have a clean water mask, small dark holes *inside that water* are good candidates for boats.\n",
    "- If the mask is too aggressive or too loose, boats will either disappear into the water or the entire surf zone turns into \"water\" and floods the bay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VERY IMPORTANT: the threshold is **not fixed**\n",
    "- There is **no universal** `threshold_for_ndwi` that works for all images.\n",
    "- Water color changes with turbidity, algae, sediment plumes, sun glint, haze, etc.\n",
    "- So you must choose the threshold **per scene**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to choose it (slider below)\n",
    "1. Drag the slider.\n",
    "2. Watch the preview mask:\n",
    "   - White = what we consider water.\n",
    "   - Dark holes *inside that white water* = possible boats.\n",
    "3. You're aiming for:\n",
    "   - Open water in the bay is mostly solid white.\n",
    "   - Boats show up as little dark cut-outs (not filled in white).\n",
    "   - Shoreline / foam isn't completely white, otherwise you'll count waves/shoals as \"water\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes:\n",
    "- Every time you move the slider, we update a global variable called `chosen_threshold_for_ndwi`.\n",
    "- The next cell (\"Finalize water mask\") will automatically grab that last value and make the official mask we use for the rest of the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future improvement:\n",
    "- We *could* automate picking this threshold by looking at the NDWI histogram and splitting water vs not-water automatically.\n",
    "- We are **not** doing that here on purpose — we want the method to stay simple, explainable, and easy to audit.\n"

    "Idea:\n",

    "- More boats usually means more active fishing at that timestamp.\n",

    "But:\n",
    "- This is **not** a biomass estimate.\n",
    "- Foam and surf can inflate counts if they pass the size test.\n",

    "Best practice:\n",
